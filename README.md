# Decentrilized app for ERC20/ERC223 token airdrop

With this app, you can transfer your token until to 150 addresses at once, simple UI, configurations and features. <br><br>
How to run the project:

* Clone this repo
* Open ./src/Airdrop.sol
* Change the token contract address with your existing token contract address (line 8)
* Deploy the contract using <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js" target="_blank">remix</a> (I prefer the 2nd one)
* Allow to airdrop contract address to spend the X your tokens
* Go to ./src/script and edit the lines N 5,10,11,12 related to your addresses
* Install node/npm if not installed
* Go to ./ and run "npm start"
* Open the browser and type localhost:3000
* Enjoy
